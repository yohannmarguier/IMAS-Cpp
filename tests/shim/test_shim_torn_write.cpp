// F6.3 `torn-write` (docs/SHIM_SUITE_CONVENTION.md S5.6): pin the shape of a
// refusal that lands mid-slice.
//
// Against a private copy of the older-DD pulse, append one slice carrying
// both a mapped, COCOS-flipped field (`global_quantities/psi_axis`, as in the
// F6.1/F6.2 round trip) and a field the older DD has no slot for at all:
// `global_quantities/rho_tor_boundary`, which the shim's own conversion map
// (IMAS-Multiversion-DD-Loader's docs/3.39.0--4.1.1.xml, rule
// `new-global-quantities-rho-tor-boundary`) records as `right_only` --
// "path added in DD 3.40.0; no counterpart in 3.39.0", forward direction
// `unmappable`. The generated write traversal has no rollback: the
// array-of-structures open already widened the container before any leaf
// write ran, and the core commits that shape at end-action time regardless
// of what follows, so the refused field is simply missing from the appended
// slice while the mapped field lands.
//
// This is a pin on an *accepted limitation*, not a statement that a torn
// write is desirable -- hence the `behaviour-pin` label rather than
// `contract-assertion`. It must keep passing exactly because nothing here
// should ever grow atomic rollback.
